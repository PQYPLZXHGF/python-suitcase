Suitcase
========

Suitcase is a library providing a set of primitives and helpers for
specifying and parsing protocols.  Suitcase provides an internal DSL
(Domain Specific Language) for describing protocol frames.  It seeks
to do for binary protocols what things like
`Django's ORM <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/topics/db/models/>`_
and
`Sqlalchemy's Declarative Syntax
<http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/orm/tutorial.html#declare-a-mapping>`_
do for Database ORMs and adopts a similar, class-based syntax.
